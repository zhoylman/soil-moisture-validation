"Note: The NLDAS-2 SAC model was not available, and thus was not included in this analysis. Therefore, the NLDAS-2 ensemble soil moisture evaluated here represents the average soil moisture model estimates from the VIC, Mosaic and Noah models. Each of the NLDAS-2 land surface models leverages a different modeling architecture (e.g. VIC (Liang et al. 1994; Wood et al. 1997), Mosaic (Koster and Suarez 1994, 1992), and Noah (Chen et al. 1996; Ek et al. 2003)) but all use the same forcing data. Therefore differences in the performance of the various NLDAS-2 models is due to the model simulation architecture.",,,,,,,
